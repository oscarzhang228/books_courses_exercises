**int**

b) Whether the user wants the application to check for updates

**bool**

c) pi (3.14159265)

**double**

d) The number of pages in a textbook (assume size is not important)

**int**

e) The length of a couch in feet, to 2 decimal places (assume size is important)

**float**

f) How many times you’ve blinked since you were born (note: answer is in the millions)

**std:int32_t**

g) A user selecting an option from a menu by letter

**char**

h) The year someone was born (assuming size is important)

**std::int16_t**
